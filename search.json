    "text": "When you hear about Olympic swimming, one name always comes to mind: Michael Phelps. Since the retirement of the legend, another name has been brought up in conversation: Caeleb Dressel. Both have won many medals in their field and have made many contributions to the sport. Yet one key factor sets them apart, it’s not just the medals or their speed, but the duration of how long they have participated in the Olympics for. \n \nIn 2000, Phelps competed in his first Olympics at the age of 15. Dressel, however, is much newer to the Olympic stage competing in his first games in 2016, showing the wide difference in the duration of their Olympic careers. \n \nPhelps background highlights how continued involvement in a sport can have its benefits. Years at the highest level provide more opportunities to develop the competitive spirit that it takes to be successful on a global stage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nswim &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nusa &lt;- swim |&gt; \n  filter(Nat == \"USA\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Swimmer) |&gt; \n  tally()\n\nmichael &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\")\n\ncaeleb &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=usa, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=michael, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"blue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=caeleb, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\" \", \n    y=\"Olympic Apperances\",\n    title=\"A Lap Around The Pool For Phelps\", \n    subtitle=\"Athlete ability is more than medals, after 6 Olympic apperances Phelps is showing \\nthat the longer you're in it the sucessful you can become\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Dressel is still in the middle of his career, his points on the chart are more recent. Phelps points span over a longer period of time, showing how dominate he has been through his different competitive periods. \n \nDressel has shown that he should be held to the same level as Phelps, breaking his record in the 100-meter butterfly. However, Phelps’s reaction times demonstrate that not only is he still able to compete, but that he is able to surpass the competition. \n \nThe 50-meter reaction times of Phelps and Dressel show how close their performances are. Both athletes maintain the same level of speed right from the start, despite there being a gap in the levels between these two. But Phelps has the advantage of his reaction times, demonstrating that with more years under him, Phelps has a bit of an athletic advantage.\n\n\nCode\nswimmers &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nfixedswim &lt;- swimmers |&gt; separate(Final, into=c(\"Final\", \"Place\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Place=gsub(\")\", \"\", Place))\n\nsplit &lt;- fixedswim |&gt; \n  filter(Event == \"Freestyle Relay\") |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(Reaction) == FALSE)\n\n\nmichael &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n\n  \ncaeleb &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=split, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=michael, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=caeleb, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=michael, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=caeleb, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Two Generations, One Sprint: More experience wins it all\", \n    subtitle=\"While Phelps and Dressel stay in the same range in their 50m time, Phelps continues \\nto prove why he is the most decorated swimmer based on his reaction time.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference becomes clearer when you consider the accomplishments of each individual athlete. Phelps has competed at the top level for six Olympic games, where Dressel has only competed in three. Having competed on this stage for so long shows how much experience and dedication can impact an athlete’s career.\n \nEvery Olympics gives these athletes more races, relays, finals, and opportunities to improve with each additional event. Phelps has had years to train and compete for 16 years, which is shown in Phelps extensive medal collection.\nThere is no doubt that with the training, Dressel could out compete Phelps in the future, as he could continue to break more records and earn more medals. Phelps’s career shows that being one of the greats requires the hard work and dedication that Phelps has put in over the years of his Olympic career. \n\n\nCode\nmedals &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\ncompmedals &lt;- medals |&gt; \n  select(Swimmer, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total) |&gt; \n  filter(Total &gt;= 6)\n\ncompmedals |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Most Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\",\n    subtitle = \"16 years of training shows why Michael Phelps is considered one of the greats\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Gavyn Nylander  |  **Source:** Olympedia\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(4)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"orange\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\n\n\n16 years of training shows why Michael Phelps is considered one of the greats\n\n\nSwimmer\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nMichael Phelps\n23\n3\n2\n28\n\n\nMark Spitz\n9\n1\n1\n11\n\n\nJenny Thompson\n8\n3\n1\n12\n\n\nMatt Biondi\n8\n2\n1\n11\n\n\nKatie Ledecky\n7\n3\n0\n10\n\n\nRyan Lochte\n6\n3\n3\n12\n\n\nGary Hall, Jr.\n5\n3\n2\n10\n\n\nCaeleb Dressel\n9\n1\n0\n10\n\n\nKristin Otto\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\nAmy Van Dyken\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\n\nBy: Gavyn Nylander | Source: Olympedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing these two athletes medal counts, the difference between them become even more obvious. Phelps has won more medals than any other swimmer. With 28 medals showing what years of work looks like. \nThe data illustrates how long-term commitment in sports has positive outcomes for the athlete. This is something that is shown in other sports, not just in the swimming world. Years of dedication to a sport contributes to building a legacy that inspires other athletes to follow long and hope to be a part of that same legacy someday."
