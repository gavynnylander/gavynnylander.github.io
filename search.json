    "text": "When you hear the words Olympic swimming, one name always comes to mind: Michael Phelps. In more recent years since the retirement of the legend, another name has been brought up in conversation: Caeleb Dressel. Both have won many medals in their field and have made many contributions to the sport. Yet one key factors sets them apart,its not just the medals or their speed, but the duration of how long they have participated in the Olympics for. \n \nIn 2000, Phelps competed in his first Olympics at the age of 15 years old. Dressel, however, is much newer to the Olympic stage competing in his first Olympic games at the 2016 Rio Olympics, showing the vast difference in the duration of their Olympic careers. \n \nPhelps background highlights how a continued involvement in a sport can have its benefits. Years at the top level provides more opportunities to develop the competitive spirit that it takes to be successful on a global stage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nswim &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nusa &lt;- swim |&gt; \n  filter(Nat == \"USA\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Swimmer) |&gt; \n  tally()\n\nmichael &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\")\n\ncaeleb &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=usa, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=michael, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"blue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=caeleb, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\" \", \n    y=\"Olympic Apperances\",\n    title=\"A Lap Around The Pool For Phelps\", \n    subtitle=\"Athlete ability is more than medals, after 6 Olympic apperances Phelps is showing \\nthat the longer you're in it the sucessful you can become\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 50-meter reaction times of Phelps and Dressel show how close their performances are. Both athletes maintain the same level of speed right from the start, despite there being a gap in the levels between these two.\n \nGiven that in the past Olympics, Dressel has shown that he should be held to the same level as Phelps, breaking his record in the 100-meter butterfly. However, Phelps’s reaction times demonstrate that not only is he still able to compete, but that he is even able to surpass the competition. \n \nSince Dressel is still in the middle of his career, his points on the chart are more recent. Phelps points span over a longer period of time, showing how dominate he has been through his different competitive periods. \n\n\nCode\nswimmers &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nfixedswim &lt;- swimmers |&gt; separate(Final, into=c(\"Final\", \"Place\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Place=gsub(\")\", \"\", Place))\n\nsplit &lt;- fixedswim |&gt; \n  filter(Event == \"Freestyle Relay\") |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(Reaction) == FALSE)\n\n\nmichael &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n\n  \ncaeleb &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=split, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=michael, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=caeleb, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=michael, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=caeleb, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Two Generations, One Sprint: More experience wins it all\", \n    subtitle=\"While Phelps and Dressel stay in the same range in their 50m time, Phelps continues \\nto prove why he is the most decorated swimmer.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference is quite noticeable when we are looking at the medals between the two athletes. In just three Olympics, Dressel has won 10 medals, with 9 of those being gold medals. But when you compare that to Phelps 28 medals, it tells us a much bigger story. This highlights how staying in a sport for a long period of time increases the chances of achieving different accomplishments in the sport. Such as Phelps setting multiple records and continuously breaking them. \n \nEvery Olympics gives these athletes more races, relays, finals, and opportunities to improve with each additional event. Phelps has had years to compete, qualify, train and win all that he could in the last 16 years which helped him with his unimaginable medal count.\nThere is no doubt that with the training, Dressel could outcompete Phelps in the future, as he could continue to break more records and earn more medals. Phelps’s career tells us that being one of the greats requires the hard work and dedication that Phelps has put in over the years of his Olympic career. \n\n\nCode\nmedals &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\ncompmedals &lt;- medals |&gt; \n  select(Swimmer, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total) |&gt; \n  filter(Total &gt;= 6)\n\ncompmedals |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Most Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\",\n    subtitle = \"While Michael Phelps may have more medals than Caeleb Dressel, looking at the table it tells us that Caeleb has only ever won gold medals in his Olympic career so far\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Gavyn Nylander  |  **Source:** Olympedia\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"orange\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\n\n\nWhile Michael Phelps may have more medals than Caeleb Dressel, looking at the table it tells us that Caeleb has only ever won gold medals in his Olympic career so far\n\n\nSwimmer\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nMichael Phelps\n23\n3\n2\n28\n\n\nMark Spitz\n9\n1\n1\n11\n\n\nJenny Thompson\n8\n3\n1\n12\n\n\nMatt Biondi\n8\n2\n1\n11\n\n\nKatie Ledecky\n7\n3\n0\n10\n\n\nRyan Lochte\n6\n3\n3\n12\n\n\nGary Hall, Jr.\n5\n3\n2\n10\n\n\nCaeleb Dressel\n9\n1\n0\n10\n\n\nKristin Otto\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\nAmy Van Dyken\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\n\nBy: Gavyn Nylander | Source: Olympedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the two swimmers is an even bigger gap when you compare the two athletes’ medal counts. Given how many years Phelps has competed at the top level, he has won 28 Olympic medals, 23 gold medals more than any other Olympic swimmer. Dressel has already won 9 gold medals, which is impressive considering he has only competed in three Olympics. \nThese numbers proves that longevity plays a more important factor in sports. This idea appears in other sports, not just in the swiming world. It shows that staying in a sport for years helps one gain more opportunities to compete, gain experience, and build their accomplishments over the years. The amount of time an athlete gives to their sport leaves a legacy for many to follow and hope to build on someday."
