    "text": "When you hear about Olympic swimming, one name always comes to mind: Michael Phelps. Since the retirement of the legend, another name has been brought up in conversation: Caeleb Dressel. Both have won many medals in their field and have made many contributions to the sport. Yet one key factor sets them apart, it’s not just the medals or their speed, but the duration of how long they have participated in the Olympics for. \n \nIn 2000, Phelps competed in his first Olympics at the age of 15. Dressel, however, is much newer to the Olympic stage competing in his first games in 2016, showing the wide difference in the duration of their Olympic careers. \n \nPhelps background highlights how continued involvement in a sport can have its benefits. Years at the highest level provides more opportunities to develop the competitive spirit that it takes to be successful on a global stage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nswim &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nusa &lt;- swim |&gt; \n  filter(Nat == \"USA\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Swimmer) |&gt; \n  tally()\n\nmichael &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\")\n\ncaeleb &lt;- usa |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=usa, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=michael, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"blue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=caeleb, aes(x=reorder(Swimmer, n), weight=n), fill = \"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\" \", \n    y=\"Olympic Apperances\",\n    title=\"A Lap Around The Pool For Phelps\", \n    subtitle=\"Athletic ability is more than medals, after 6 Olympic apperances Phelps is showing \\nthat the longer you're in it the more sucessful you can become\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Dressel is still in the middle of his career, his points on the chart are more recent. Phelps points span over a longer period of time, showing how dominate he has been through his different competitive periods. \n \nDressel has shown that he should be held to the same level as Phelps, breaking his record in the 100-meter butterfly. However, Phelps’s reaction times demonstrate that not only is he still able to compete, but that he is able to surpass the competition. \n \nThe 50-meter reaction times of Phelps and Dressel show how close their performances are. Both athletes maintain the same level of speed right from the start, despite there being a gap in the levels between these two. But Phelps has the advantage of his reaction times, demonstrating that with more years under him, Phelps has a bit of an athletic advantage.\n\n\nCode\nswimmers &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nfixedswim &lt;- swimmers |&gt; separate(Final, into=c(\"Final\", \"Place\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Place=gsub(\")\", \"\", Place))\n\nsplit &lt;- fixedswim |&gt; \n  filter(Event == \"Freestyle Relay\") |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(Reaction) == FALSE)\n\n\nmichael &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n\n  \ncaeleb &lt;- split |&gt; \n  filter(Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=split, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=michael, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=caeleb, aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=michael, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=caeleb, \n    aes(x=Reaction, y=`50m`, label=Swimmer)) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Two Generations, One Sprint: More experience wins it all\", \n    subtitle=\"While Phelps and Dressel stay in the same range in their 50m time, Phelps continues \\nto prove why he is the most decorated swimmer based on his reaction time.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Olympedia | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference becomes clearer when you consider the accomplishments of each individual athlete. Phelps has competed at the top level for six Olympic games, where Dressel has only competed in three. Having competed on this stage for so long shows how much experience and dedication can impact an athlete’s career.\n \nEvery Olympics gives these athletes more races, relays, finals, and opportunities to improve with each additional event. Phelps has had years to train and compete for 16 years, which is shown in Phelps extensive medal collection. \n  \nThere is no doubt that with the training, Dressel could out compete Phelps in the future, as he could continue to break more records and earn more medals. Phelps’s career shows that being one of the greats requires the hard work and dedication that Phelps has put in over the years of his Olympic career.  \n\n\nCode\nmedals &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC350-Data3 - CaelebvMichaelData.csv\")\n\ncompmedals &lt;- medals |&gt; \n  select(Swimmer, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total) |&gt; \n  filter(Total &gt;= 6)\n\ncompmedals |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Most Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\",\n    subtitle = \"16 years of training shows why Michael Phelps is considered one of the greats\"\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Gavyn Nylander  |  **Source:** Olympedia\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(4)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=13)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Michael Phelps\") \n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"orange\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Swimmer == \"Caeleb Dressel\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Medals Won by Olympic Swimmers\n\n\n16 years of training shows why Michael Phelps is considered one of the greats\n\n\nSwimmer\nGold\nSilver\nBronze\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nMichael Phelps\n23\n3\n2\n28\n\n\nMark Spitz\n9\n1\n1\n11\n\n\nJenny Thompson\n8\n3\n1\n12\n\n\nMatt Biondi\n8\n2\n1\n11\n\n\nKatie Ledecky\n7\n3\n0\n10\n\n\nRyan Lochte\n6\n3\n3\n12\n\n\nGary Hall, Jr.\n5\n3\n2\n10\n\n\nCaeleb Dressel\n9\n1\n0\n10\n\n\nKristin Otto\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\nAmy Van Dyken\n6\n0\n0\n6\n\n\n\nBy: Gavyn Nylander | Source: Olympedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing these two athletes medal counts, the difference between them becomes even more obvious.

With 28 medals showing what years of hard work looks like. \n \nThe data illustrates how long-term commitment in sports has positive outcomes for athletes. This is something that is shown in other sports, not just in the swimming world. Years of dedication to a sport contributes to building a legacy that inspires other athletes to follow long and hope to be a part of that same legacy someday."

    "text": "At the end of each college football season, the topic of The Heisman Trophy and who may win it is widely talked about. Reporters, past winners, and fans all take into consideration how the players take charge in their position, how they are contributing to their team’s success, and how their season is going. This year one name jumped into the conversation, Emmett Johnson. Fans believe that Johnson should be a contender for this award as he has helped the huskers in more ways than one throughout this season.\nJohnson has proven that he deserves to be taken seriously for this award. He shows how not only can he compete with some of the top running backs, but that he continues to stay consistent in his playmaking which allows him to continue to help improve the huskers offense.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nfb &lt;- read_csv(\"EJHeisman.csv\") |&gt; \n  clean_names() |&gt; \n  mutate(player_team = paste0(player, \", \", team))\n\nheisman &lt;- read_csv(\"oldheisman.csv\")\n\n\nyards &lt;- heisman |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Yds &gt;= 1821\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\nej &lt;- heisman |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Emmett Johnson\"\n  )\n\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=yards, aes(x= reorder(Player,Yds), weight=Yds), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=ej, aes(x= reorder(Player,Yds), weight=Yds), fill=\"red\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\" \", \n    y=\"Total Yards\", \n    title=\"Does Emmett Johnson Compare to Past Heisman Winners?\", \n    subtitle=\"Total yards show how Johnson's 2025 season can measure up to the same level as past \\nwinning running backs. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at past winning running backs, it’s clear that Johnson can compare to these past winners. Being able to put up the number of yards that shows Johnson can compete tells us that he can put in the work. Johnson is able to deliver skilled performances, helping contribute to his impressive yardage over the season.\nLooking at the stats, it’s clear that Johnson is very similar to these winners past numbers. His season has shown us that he is able to create the same impact that previous winners had, showing his reliability, and how powerful his overall performance has been. This definitely shows that Emmett Johnson has made a name for himself this past season.\n\n\nCode\ntop100 &lt;- fb |&gt; \n  top_n(100, wt=-rk)\n\ntop10 &lt;- fb |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=-rk)\n\nemmett &lt;- top10 |&gt; \n  filter(player == \"Emmett Johnson\")\n\nlove &lt;- top10 |&gt; \n  filter(player == \"Jeremiyah Love\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=top100, aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a), color = \"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=top10, aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=emmett, aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a), color = \"#d00000\") +\n  geom_point(data=love, aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a), color = \"#0c2340\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=emmett, \n    aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a, label=player)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=love, \n    aes(x=ru_yds, y=ru_y_a, label=player)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Rushing Yards\", \n    y=\"Yards Per Attempt\", \n    title=\"Comparing Emmett Johnson's Standing Amoung Top Rushers\", \n    subtitle=\"Comparing total rushing yards and yards per attempt to highlight Johnson efficency against \\nother running backs.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Gavyn Nylander\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the number of yards to other leading running backs, Johnson continues to stand out. Guys who put up these types of numbers are in the right area to be considered for The Heisman. His ability to gain yards in different ways, run, and stay consistent highlights how important he is to his team and their offense.\nJohnson has proven what type of athlete he is. He continues to show how well-rounded he is when it comes to making plays. He shows us how he is able to not only put up rushing yards for his team but shows us how well rounded he is by putting up receiving yards as well. The award looks for athletes who excel in more than one skill, and Johnson fits into that category perfectly. Having someone like Johnson who can gain impressive yardage in both rushing and receiving displays how he continuously helps his teams offense and highlights how he has stepped up and has become the player he is today.\n\n\nCode\ntop10 &lt;- fb |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=-rk)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(y=reorder(player_team, re_yds), x=ru_yds, xend=re_yds),size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n     x=\"Rushing vs.Recieving Yards\", \n    y=\" \",\n    title=\"Rushing Yards vs. Recieving Yards in the Top 10\", \n    subtitle = \"Emmett proves that he is an all around athlete with his &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;rushing yards&lt;/span&gt; and his &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;recieving yards&lt;/span&gt; telling a story of his various plays.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Gavyn Nylander\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmett Johnson proves that he is a reliable player on the huskers offense. Looking at his performance compared to other top running backs, Johnson fits into that Heisman winner category more than we knew.\nLets make one thing clear: Emmett Johnson should be taken seriously when it comes to the Heisman conversation."
